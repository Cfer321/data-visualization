Hello World!

The csv files are the data files downloaded from the US EPA TRI website, it has data for years from 1987-2022. They include data including qualitative factors, like whether or not facilities produce carcinogens or adhere to the Clean Air Act, and quantitative factors, like how much of one emission is produced. Given the five year gap between the CSV files, they should provide a timeline of showcasing whether EPA policies like the Clean Air Act have been effective.
