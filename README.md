Hello World!

This was a part of my final project for data visualizations. Here, I made various visualizations on the EPA TRI data, which aims at showing emissions at EPA facilities since 1987. The data includes qualitative factors, like the industry sector type or whether or not facilities adhered to the Clean Air Act, and quantitative factors, like how much of one emission is produced. Given the five year gap between the CSV files, they should provide a timeline of showcasing whether EPA policies like the Clean Air Act have been effective.
Some graphs, measured across years, included:
- How many facilities made carcinogen-producing particles
- How much emissions were produced across all facilities
- Industry sector breakdown of the facilities

Overall, the trends showed that the Clean Air Act passing in 1992 was instrumental in curbing emissions, although they are slightly rising again as of 2022.
